# BankAccount Part 2: Inheritance and Modularization

This project demonstrates the use of inheritance and modularization in 
Python for a banking system. It includes:
- A base class `BankAccount`
- Subclasses `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount` that inherit from 
`BankAccount`
- Methods to handle deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and interest 
calculations
